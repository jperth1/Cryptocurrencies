# Cryptocurrencies

This repository uses unsupervised machine learning to evaluate and classify tradable cryptocurrencies. The following actions were executed:

-	Preprocessing the data for PCA 
-	Reducing data dimensions using PCA
-	Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means
-	Visualization of cryptocurrencies results

### Preprocessing and Reducing Data using PCA

Using pandas, the cryptocurrency data is formatted, scaled, and repaired to apply Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensions to three principal components.

### Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-means

An elbow curve is created using hvPlot to predict the ideal K clusters, where K = 4. Using the K-Means algorithm, predictions are made to cluster the PCA cryptocurrencies data.

### Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

The three clusters generated by the PCA and K-Means algorithm are displayed in a 3D-scatter plot which includes each cryptocurrencyâ€™s principal component value, name, and algorithm used. Additionally, a table is created to future visualize the cryptocurrency data which includes the name, algorithm, proof type, total coin supply, coins minded, and their class. MinMaxScaler().fit_transform() is then used to scale the columns TotalCoinsMined and TotalCoinSupply and displayed in a 2D-scatter plot.
